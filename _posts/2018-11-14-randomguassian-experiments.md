I recently started to play around with [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and while Iâ€™m not an expert yet I find I enjoy it very much.

I came across a [Points Distribution dilemma](https://www.reddit.com/r/processing/comments/9wutfp/point_distribution_dilemma/) post on r/processing subreddit where [addictedtobiscuits](https://www.reddit.com/user/addictedtobiscuits) is trying to recreate following [image](https://imgur.com/a/RXJxFtO) with processing.
